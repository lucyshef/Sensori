# Lucy's notes
- modified get_npy.py to run on ,y M/s^2 joined parquet files (so basically select time + acc_x,y,z only, rename cols and convert to g)
- created conda env `sensori` on hpc

# Sensori

*Learning health from a day in motion.*

----------------

Sensori is a self-supervised foundation model that learns general-purpose
representations of human health and disease directly from 24 hours of raw
tri-axial wrist movement.

This repository provides tools to:

- Pretrain Sensori on new, unlabelled accelerometer datasets.
- Extract day-level health representations using pretrained Sensori weights.
- Evaluate frozen representations on downstream health and activity tasks.

The preprocessing pipeline supports common wrist-accelerometer formats,
including CWA, GT3X, BIN and timestamped CSV files, with optional gzip
compression.

## Repository structure

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/` | Model architecture, data loaders, pretraining and embedding extraction |
| `config/` | Hydra model and pretraining configuration |
| `scripts/get_npy.py` | Raw-recording-to-NPY preprocessing |
| `tutorials/` | Executable human activity recognition (HAR) and NHANES notebooks |
| `docs/` | Project website and step-by-step tutorials |

## Installation

Sensori requires Python 3.13. Clone the repository, create an isolated
environment and install the package:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OxWearables/Sensori.git
cd Sensori

conda create -n sensori python=3.13 pip
conda activate sensori
pip install -e .
```

- For a hardware-specific CPU or CUDA build, install PyTorch using the
[official selector](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) before installing
Sensori.
- Reading and processing raw CWA, GT3X and BIN device files also requires
Java 8 or newer.

## Model weights and embedding extraction

By default, Sensori downloads the pretrained [model and
configuration](https://huggingface.co/light156/Sensori) to `checkpoint/` and
saves embeddings in `sensori_embeddings/`. Existing downloads are reused.

```bash
python -m sensori.inference --data-path /path/to/processed_participants
```

To use a local model instead, provide both its checkpoint and configuration:

```bash
python -m sensori.inference \
  --data-path /path/to/processed_participants \
  --checkpoint-path /path/to/model.pt \
  --config-path /path/to/config_model.yaml \
  --output-path /path/to/embeddings.npy
```

## Prepare input data

The released model expects finite `float32` XYZ acceleration in units of g,
sampled at 10 Hz. Each complete 24-hour array has shape `(2880, 300, 3)`:
2,880 consecutive 30-second windows, 300 samples per window and three axes.

Use the standalone preprocessing script to create the required participant/day
layout from one raw recording:

```bash
python scripts/get_npy.py \
  --file /path/to/participant_001.cwa \
  --output /path/to/processed_participants
```

The output has the following structure:

```text
processed_participants/
├── participant_001/
│   ├── day_0.npy
│   ├── day_1.npy
│   ├── info.json
│   └── wear_duration.csv
└── participant_002/
    └── ...
```

The script applies the preprocessing and quality-control contract used for the
released model: gravity calibration, 5 Hz low-pass filtering, resampling to
10 Hz, non-wear detection, complete finite calendar days, at least 22 hours of
wear, fewer than 10 interruptions and mean ENMO no greater than 200 mg. Exit
code `3` means that processing completed successfully but no day passed quality
control.

## Pretraining

Edit `config/config_train.yaml`, or override its values with Hydra from the
command line:

```bash
python -m sensori.train \
  train_data.data_path=/path/to/processed_participants \
  device_num=1
```

Command-line overrides take precedence over the YAML configuration. By default,
pretraining requires at least six eligible days per participant. See
`config/config_train.yaml` for all training options.
